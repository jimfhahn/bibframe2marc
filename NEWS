* Series fields (4XX and 8XX) will create BF Hubs.
* New Work types for Monograph, Serial, Series, Integrating, MusicAudio (subclass of Audio) and NonMusicAudio (subclass of Audio) created.
* Address issues a number of issues with too few 008 values (resulting in too-short 008s), incorrect 008 dates, and empty fields.
* Output 340 $l.
* Output 720 based on Uncontrolled type.
* Simplify 334 context processing.
* More flexible xpath selection to accommodate various RDF/XML shapes.
